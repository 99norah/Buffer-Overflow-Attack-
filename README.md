# Buffer-Overflow-Attack-
In this project, we exploited Buffer Overflow vulnerability for learning purpose 


# Buffer Overflow Attack Overview
In this lab we will understand the concept of Buffer overflow, and try to edit the file exploit.py to make the attack successful. Buffer Overflow Attack is defined as the condition when the program tries to fill the data beyond the boundaries of fixed length buffers. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to handle the flow control of the program, through execute arbitrary pieces of code. This vulnerability comes because the mixing of the storage of data (e.g. buffers) and controls (e.g. return addresses). The overflow of buffers can be affected on the control flow of the program, because the return address is changed .
